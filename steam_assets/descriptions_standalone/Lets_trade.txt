Adds caravan trade based buildings to player settlements. They simulate barter trade system and enable easy access to resources needed in other buildings without the need to micromanage trade routes.

[h1]Why Better Settlements mods?[/h1]
I created those to give players more options of solving economic challenges, roleplaying their settlements, and removing some common pain points, while staying as vanilla as possible.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Lets Trade! mod does?[/h1]
[b]The main idea[/b] behind this mod was to create alternative to satelite settlements - ones you build just to supply main city with specific goods needed for buildings to operate. It focuses mainly on trades related to food industry. I don't want to take vanilla pleasure of founding towns focused on industry (mithril/adamantine/gold/diamond and so on), so those you will need to build yourselves.
[b]So how this mod works?[/b] It adds new group of buildings: "traders", and adds to it 15 buildings. There are 5 types of different 'trade routes' that you can create with those buildings, each with 3 different subtypes depending on what resource you want to sell and buy. Each trade route gives you 3 different resources that can be later used in other buildings in your settlement (view attached graph to see what building loops are connected to vanilla and what to other Better Settlements mods).
[b]What you can sell?[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Gems[/b] - all gem types.
[*][b]Ingots[/b] - all ingots except for mithril and adamantine.
[*][b]Wood[/b] - only wood planks, and only more valuable than 7g. Wood worth less is unlikely to be produced in quantities that could sustain any meaningful trade route.
