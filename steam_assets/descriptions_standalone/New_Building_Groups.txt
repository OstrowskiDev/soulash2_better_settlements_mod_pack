Framework for other Better Settlements mods. 
Adds new building groups to game build menu: "Traders" and "Specialists"

[h1]Why Better Settlements mods?[/h1]
I created those to give players more options of solving economic challenges, roleplaying their settlements, and removing some common pain points, while staying as vanilla as possible.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: New Building Groups mod does?[/h1]
This mod adds new building groups: "traders" and "specialists". You will see those after pressing 'L' when you are inside one of your t2 or higher settlements. It is required by most of mods from Better Settlements series.
