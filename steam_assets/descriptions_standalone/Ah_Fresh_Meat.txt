Having piles of raw meat from all those farms and hunters? Don't know what to do with all those animals from ranches? Now you can process it all with t3 Butcher Shop and t3 Tavern Upgrade: Roast!

[h1]Why Better Settlements mods?[/h1]
I created those to give players more options of solving economic challenges, roleplaying their settlements, and removing some common pain points, while staying as vanilla as possible.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Ah! Fresh Meat! does?[/h1]
It adds more options to meat industry: notably [b]Butcher Shop[/b] and t3 [b]Tavern upgrade: Roast[/b].
[list]
[*][b]Butcher Shop[/b] takes animals produced in ranches and farms and does what he does best. This includes production of larva and slugs related meat. 
[*][b]Tavern upgrade Roast[/b] is t3 building that uses following recipes:  roast, meatloaf and cooked meat. 
[*][b]Roast[/b] is changed by this mod to give 85 food, otherwise whole process would be pointless. It takes 2 meat and 1 sugar to produce. 
[*][b]Meatloaf[/b] takes 2 meat of one type (normal, slugs, larva) and 1 herbs.
[/list]
