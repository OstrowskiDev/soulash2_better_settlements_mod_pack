Expands and improves vanilla smelter buildings.

[h1]Why Better Settlements mods?[/h1]
I created those to give players more options of solving economic challenges, roleplaying their settlements, and removing some common pain points, while staying as vanilla as possible.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Smelters mod does?[/h1]
This one is pretty basic: [b]adds two specialized smelter buildings[/b]. One only smelts tin and copper to produce bronze ingots, second takes coal and iron to produce steel ingots. So you will not end up with ingots you don't want (copper/iron ingots). Those buildings are available in new tab "specialists". This mod also enhances production of vanilla smelter, so you should be able to smelt all ore that is produced.
