[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Smelters mod does?[/h1]

Tis one is pretty basic: adds two specialized smelter buildings. One only smelts tin and copper to produce bronze ingots, second takes coal and iron to produce steel ingots. So you will not end up with ingots you don't want (copper/iron ingots). Those buildings are available in new tab "specialists".

This mod uses Better Settlements - New Building Groups framework to create additional "Specialists" building group. It is required for mod to work. Also I suggest moving this framework to the top of Better Settlements mods list in game mod manager, many other mods from this series rely on it.
