[*]Subscribe to this mod.
[*]Create new world and have fun.
[*]Alternatively you can add this mod to your existing save. 
The guide on how to do that is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3328087872]here[/url]. To all my knowledge it should work fine but [b]BACKUP YOUR SAVES BEFORE YOU DO THAT[/b] anyway, better save than sorry.

[h1]How to uninstall?[/h1]
Currently you [b]CAN'T[/b] uninstall any mod that was once installed without breaking your saves that were using it. But if you want to start new world without it just unsubscribe.
