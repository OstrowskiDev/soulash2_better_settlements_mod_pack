[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Ah! Fresh Meat! does?[/h1]
It adds more options to meat industry: notably Butcher Shop and t3 Tavern upgrade: Roast. Butcher takes animals produced in ranches and farms and does what he does best. This includes production of larva and slugs related meat. Than you can put this meat to better use by upgrading your Taverns to T3 (build extension using building called: Tavern upgrade: Roast), that has roast recipe, meatloaf recipe and cooked meat recipe. Roast is changed by this mod to give 85 food, otherwise whole process would be pointless. Roast takes 2 meat and 1 sugar to produce. Meatloaf takes 2 meat of one type (normal, slugs, larva) and 1 herbs. Herbs can be provided by Elven Woods Traders, and sugar from Rasimi Traders from Better Settlements Lets Trade! mod, or by your satelite settlements if you prefer vanilla way.
