[h1]Why Better Settlements mods?[/h1]
I created those to give players more options of solving economic challenges, roleplaying their settlements, and removing some common pain points related to settlements. While staying as vanilla as possible.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Ah! Fresh Meat! does?[/h1]
It adds more options to meat industry: notably Butcher Shop and t3 Tavern upgrade: Roast. Butcher takes animals produced in ranches and farms and does what he does best. This includes production of larva and slugs related meat. Than you can put this meat to better use by upgrading your Taverns to T3 (build extension using building called: Tavern upgrade: Roast), that has roast recipe, meatloaf recipe and cooked meat recipe. Roast is changed by this mod to give 85 food, otherwise whole process would be pointless. Roast takes 2 meat and 1 sugar to produce. Meatloaf takes 2 meat of one type (normal, slugs, larva) and 1 herbs. Herbs can be provided by Elven Woods Traders, and sugar from Rasimi Traders from Better Settlements Lets Trade! mod, or by your satelite settlements if you prefer vanilla way.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Lets Trade! mod does?[/h1]
The main idea behind this mod was to create alternative to satelite settlements - ones you build just to supply main city with specific goods needed for buildings to operate. It focuses mainly on trades related to food industry. I don't want to take vanilla pleasure of founding towns focused on industry (mithril/adamantine/gold/diamond and so on), so those you will need to build yourselves.
So how this mod works? Id adds new group of buildings: "traders", and adds to it 15 buildings. There are 5 types of different 'trade routes' that you can create with those buildings, each with 3 different subtypes depending on what resource you want to sell and buy. Each trade route gives you 3 different resources that can be later used in other buildings in your settlement (view attached graph to see what building loops are connected to vanilla and what to other Better Settlements mods).
What you can sell?
[list]
Gems - all gem types.
Ingots - all ingots except for mithril and adamantine.
Wood - only wood planks, and only more valuable than 7g. Wood worth less is unlikely to be produced in quantities that could sustain any meaningful trade route.
[/list]
What you can buy for sold goods?
[list]
Elven Wood Traders: flower pollen (apiary), blueberries (bakery), herbs (tavern upgrade: roast).
Boreal Goods Traders: ground jelly (bat ranch), mush wood (slugs farm), orange mushrooms (tavern).
Rasimi Traders: savory branch (spice seekers -> alchemists), swamp grass (huge slugs ranch), sugar (tavern).
Human Traders: wheat grain (cow ranch, pig ranch, chicken ranch, windmill, tavern), straw (cow ranch), strawberries (bakery)
Barley Hills Traders: barley (goat ranch, sheep ranch, pig ranch, chicken ranch, windmill, tavern).
[/list]
For better visual representation look at buildings production routes graph. It has all important connections added with Better Settlements mods. Though for readability I have not included some of vanilla connections. There is already lots of happening in this graph. Important change to vanilla is removal of pie recipes form Tavern and moving them to Bakery.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: New Building Groups mod does?[/h1]

This mod adds new building groups: "traders" and "specialists". You will see those after pressing 'L' when you are inside one of your t2 or higher settlements. It is required by most of mods from Better Settlements series.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Smelters mod does?[/h1]

Tis one is pretty basic: adds two specialized smelter buildings. One only smelts tin and copper to produce bronze ingots, second takes coal and iron to produce steel ingots. So you will not end up with ingots you don't want (copper/iron ingots). Those buildings are available in new tab "specialists".

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Wheat And Bees does?[/h1]

[list]
[*]It adds more recipes to bakery and tavern, notably: adds barley wheat equivalent of recipes to bakery so now your towns that are relaying on it for food production doesn't feel like worse version of wheat ones. Wheat is still better as in vanilla though. 

[*]Adds cheese and mushroom soup recipes to tavern. So now milk and orange mushrooms will be used for something.

[*]Adds player T3 apiary building that does not have any biome/map resource requirements but is more resource heavy to build. It will give you not only honey but also bee wax that is required to build all those cool stuff in your settlements. 

[*]Adds two specialized windmill buildings: they produce only barley/wheat flour so you can control what type of grain goes to your ranches and what goes towards flour production

[*]Adds gingerbread recipe to bakery, so your newly produced honey form apiary will have additional usage. This works both with wheat and barley flour.
[/list]

[h1]Dependencies[/h1]
This mod uses Better Settlements - New Building Groups framework to create additional "Specialists" building group. It is required for mod to work. Also I suggest moving this framework to the top of Better Settlements mods list in game mode manager, many other mods from this series rely on it.
