[h1]Why Better Settlements mods?[/h1]

I created those to give players more options of solving economic challenges, roleplaying their settlements, and removing some common pain points related to settlements. While staying as vanilla as possible.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Ah Fresh Meat! does?[/h1]
It adds more options to meat industry: notably Butcher Shop and t3 Tavern upgrade: Roast. Butcher takes animals produced in ranches and farms and does what he does best. This includes production of larva and slugs related meat. Than you can put this meat to better use by upgrading your Taverns to T3 (build extension using building called: Tavern upgrade: Roast), that has roast recipe, meatloaf recipe and cooked meat recipe. Roast is changed by this mod to give 85 food, otherwise whole process would be pointless. Roast takes 2 meat and 1 sugar to produce. Meatloaf takes 2 meat of one type (normal, slugs, larva) and 1 herbs. Herbs can be provided by Elven Woods Traders, and sugar from Rasimi Traders from Better Settlements Lets Trade! mod, or by your satelite settlements if you prefer vanilla way.


[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: New Building Groups mod does?[/h1]

This mod adds new building groups: "traders" and "specialists". You will see those after pressing 'L' when you are inside one of your t2 or higher settlements. It is required by most of mods from Better Settlements series.

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Smelters mod does?[/h1]

Tis one is pretty basic: adds two specialized smelter buildings. One only smelts tin and copper to produce bronze ingots, second takes coal and iron to produce steel ingots. So you will not end up with ingots you don't want (copper/iron ingots). Those buildings are available in new tab "specialists".

[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Wheat And Bees does?[/h1]

[list]
[*]It adds more recipes to bakery and tavern, notably: adds barley wheat equivalent of recipes to bakery so now your towns that are relaying on it for food production doesn't feel like worse version of wheat ones. Wheat is still better as in vanilla though. 

[*]Adds cheese and mushroom soup recipes to tavern. So now milk and orange mushrooms will be used for something.

[*]Adds player T3 apiary building that does not have any biome/map resource requirements but is more resource heavy to build. It will give you not only honey but also bee wax that is required to build all those cool stuff in your settlements. 

[*]Adds two specialized windmill buildings: they produce only barley/wheat flour so you can control what type of grain goes to your ranches and what goes towards flour production

[*]Adds gingerbread recipe to bakery, so your newly produced honey form apiary will have additional usage. This works both with wheat and barley flour.
[/list]

[h1]Dependencies[/h1]
This mod uses Better Settlements - New Building Groups framework to create additional "Specialists" building group. It is required for mod to work. Also I suggest moving this framework to the top of Better Settlements mods list in game mode manager, many other mods from this series rely on it.

[h1]How to install?[/h1]

[h1]How to uninstall?[/h1]
Currently you [b]CAN'T[/b] uninstall any mod that was once installed without breaking your saves that were using it. But if you want to start new world without it just unsubscribe.
