[h1]What exactly Better Settlements: Lets Trade! mod does?[/h1]
The main idea behind this mod was to create alternative to satelite settlements - ones you build just to supply main city with specific goods needed for buildings to operate. It focuses mainly on trades related to food industry. I don't want to take vanilla pleasure of founding towns focused on industry (mithril/adamantine/gold/diamond and so on), so those you will need to build yourselves.
So how this mod works? Id adds new group of buildings: "traders", and adds to it 15 buildings. There are 5 types of different 'trade routes' that you can create with those buildings, each with 3 different subtypes depending on what resource you want to sell and buy. Each trade route gives you 3 different resources that can be later used in other buildings in your settlement (view attached graph to see what building loops are connected to vanilla and what to other Better Settlements mods).
What you can sell?
[list]
[*]Gems - all gem types.
[*]Ingots - all ingots except for mithril and adamantine.
[*]Wood - only wood planks, and only more valuable than 7g. Wood worth less is unlikely to be produced in quantities that could sustain any meaningful trade route.
[/list]
What you can buy for sold goods?
[list]
[*]Elven Wood Traders: flower pollen (apiary), blueberries (bakery), herbs (tavern upgrade: roast).
[*]Boreal Goods Traders: ground jelly (bat ranch), mush wood (slugs farm), orange mushrooms (tavern).
[*]Rasimi Traders: savory branch (spice seekers -> alchemists), swamp grass (huge slugs ranch), sugar (tavern).
[*]Human Traders: wheat grain (cow ranch, pig ranch, chicken ranch, windmill, tavern), straw (cow ranch), strawberries (bakery)
[*]Barley Hills Traders: barley (goat ranch, sheep ranch, pig ranch, chicken ranch, windmill, tavern).
[/list]
For better visual representation look at buildings production routes graph. It has all important connections added with Better Settlements mods. Though for readability I have not included some of vanilla connections. There is already lots of happening in this graph. Important change to vanilla is removal of pie recipes form Tavern and moving them to Bakery.

This mod uses Better Settlements - New Building Groups framework to create additional "Traders" building group. It is required for mod to work. Also I suggest moving this framework to the top of Better Settlements mods list in game mod manager, many other mods from this series rely on it.
